									<p><strong>Information technology</strong> spans most of my career in the workplace which stretches some 40 years. </p>
										<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How it all began.</h2>
									<p>	I don’t recall the motivation, but I do remember purchasing a Commodore VIC20 when they first can out. My frustration with programming probably started then, trying to do the “Hello World” project, reading and writing to a cassette tape attached to the VIC. </p>
									<p>Later when I had joined the hospitality industry as a porter my decision to move to Night Audit was based largely on being taught to use the computer system. At that time Porters didn’t get to use the computer, only the Concierge could even get close to it. If he wasn’t there you had to ring reception for information. Twelve months later, in a different hotel and still working the graveyard shift, we seemed to be getting more than our fair share of glitches and issues. No Remote dial in at that time, so it was necessary to phone tech support. They would dictate commands that you needed to type in (exactly) and presto the problem was solved, and the shift could continue. After a while, there was rarely a need to phone the tech support as I remembered what needed to be entered for a given issue. This knowledge secured a position in Port Moresby where a computer system had just been installed. My job apart from running Reception was to look after any computer issues and liaise with the software house based in Sydney.</p>
									<p>Naturally after speaking to Sydney several times a week for twelve months, I had formed a relationship with the manager, and they offered me a job doing support based in Sydney.</p>
									<p>I ended up working for that business on and off for over twenty years. Circumstances would find me bored and unfulfilled in a particular role so I’d off and find something else. The happiest of these something else’s was P&O Australian Resorts, employed as I.T. Manager. That was a great business and I learned a lot about hardware and cabling while visiting quite beautiful locations.</p>
									<p>Some little while later and I’m back at the software house now in the role of Product Manager, working with clients, developers and support to make the product better. It is interesting that they kept employing me again and again.</p>
									<p>Fast forward some years and a sea change found me in beautiful Cairns where I was indeed fortunate to find they have software houses here too. So another go at being a Product Manager / Client Liaison / Project Manager / budding Solution Architect.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>And Now</h2>
									<p>Nowadays I’m a technology consultant to the hospitability and tourism industry, enrolled with RMIT doing a Bachelor of Information Technology Online and working towards my Ideal Job. A Fully Fledged Accredited Solution Architect.</p>
									<p>	I chose to study at RMIT, partly because of the pedigree, partly because the introduction courses started at a time that suited me nicely and partly because of the wonderful sales call I received after indicating my initial interest.</p>
									<p>	I am absolutely confident that over the coming years of study I will learn a very great deal, even now in these first few weeks I’m finding myself enthused by the interaction with my classmates and the ideas they bring to our discussions.</p>
