As this is my first time to work with an online team for study purposes, so I was quite sceptical and nervous at first that it would quickly deteriorate. I was quite concerned that other students very quickly made teams from the get-go, and I didn’t have a team.

Our team, “The G6 Internet Explorers”, came together quite naturally. We are all from different cities and half of us in different countries. None of us is an expert or had much to do with Github, so it was a group learning experience. We found common ground using tools that we are familiar with such as Microsoft Teams and uploading Ms Documents such as word and excel. As we developed our skills, we were “brave” enough to edit singular text files on GitHub. 

Even with time zone differences, we managed to all get together weekly then biweekly and every other day towards the end of the assignment. Although our team did not nominate a leader, one member was very helpful in starting the GitHub and Teams site and hosting the meetings. During the meetings, all members were quick to volunteer for tasks and I feel they were distributed evenly by agreeing with each other rather than being delegated.

I have enjoyed working with my team and hope to work with them again in the future and catch up for a drink one of these days. I wish them al the best with their studies and careers.
