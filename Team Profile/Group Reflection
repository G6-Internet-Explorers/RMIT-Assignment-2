This is the Group Reflection Text

I believe this group is outstanding, having come together fairly organically by placing our names in an available group rather than scouting around looking for people of like interests or in the same town or city. It is our diversity that allows us to present interesting and unique points of view. We have worked well together on common goals. As is evident by the differences in our ideal jobs and the blend of personality types we each bring unique experiences both life and employment to enrich the team. We had some initial issues with GitHub as the invitations to join the newly created organisation appear to have been blocked by RMIT infrastructure, however this was quickly overcome. We had chosen as a group to utilise Microsoft Teams for our online correspondence and by and large that has worked quite well although I would be reluctant to use it in the future as a project management tool. GitHub for the purposes of this assignment has also had a number of constraints as it is not possible to merge a word document or an excel spreadsheet and so we have where practical created text documents, which will then have to be copied into Word to create the final PDF. So a bit of frustration on the duplication of effort. These criticisms you will note are of the tools not anyone of the fabulous team. 
I look forward to working with all my new ‘mates’ on the next team project.
