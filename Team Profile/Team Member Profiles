Hi, My name is Brian Dean and my RMIT student number is  

S3831349  and my student email address is s3831349@student.rmit.edu.au in case you have trouble reaching my through the usual channels. 

 

I was born in Brisbane, but spent much of my working life in Sydney. My wife and I are now living on the northern beaches of Cairns in a little spot called Yorkeys Knob, with our twelve year old ginger rescue cat called "Pumpkin" 

 

I enjoy reading, mainly sci fi fiction, cooking and a spot of gardening. 

 

Currently self employed as a technology consultant to the hospitality and tourism sector, after many years working in that industry and software houses. I am doing my Bachelor of I.T. to fill in the many holes in my knowledge and for accreditation for all those years of doing stuff.
