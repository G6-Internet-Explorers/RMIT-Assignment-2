Hi, My name is Brian Dean and my RMIT student number is S3831349 and my student email address is s3831349@student.rmit.edu.au 
in case you have trouble reaching my through the usual channels. 
I was born in Brisbane, but spent much of my working life in Sydney. 
My wife and I are now living on the northern beaches of Cairns in a little spot called Yorkeys Knob, 
with our twelve year old ginger rescue cat called "Pumpkin" 
I enjoy reading, mainly sci fi fiction, cooking and a spot of gardening. 
Currently self employed as a technology consultant to the hospitality and tourism sector, 
after many years working in that industry and software houses. 
I am doing my Bachelor of I.T. to fill in the many holes in my knowledge and for accreditation for all those years of doing.

G'day, My name is Shane Thacker, and my current home is Toowoomba Queensland.
My RMIT student number is s3827970 and my email is thacker.shane@gmail.com
Born in Adelaide, I moved to Queensland when I was eighteen, where I got a job in the furniture industry. By twenty, I was going back and forth to Indonesia to train the suppliers on how to sand, prepare, upholster, assemble, glaze and upholster furniture for the Australian company I was working for. At twenty-one, I made the permanent move to Indonesia working for that company then eventually by the time I was twenty-two started my own teak outdoor furniture company. After the 2008 global crisis wiped out my customers, then me off the map, I worked for a European company managing their properties in Indonesia. When those properties were sold off in 2015, I joined an international school and became the school director.
My main interests are barbeque low and slow and fishing, both of which involve knocking back a few cold beers. I have three kids the youngest being six and extremely naughty, most likely because he is too spoilt. Flight simulation is my main “do on own” hobby, but I rarely find time these days.
I am working towards a bachelor of international business where I hope to move into a management position of an international company within the next five years.

My dream is to become an Artificial Intelligence Engineer. I find writing code quite enjoyable. My first program was a primitive
